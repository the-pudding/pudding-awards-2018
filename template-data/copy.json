The data visualization not only proved to you how age and gender limit the role of women and people of color in Shakespeare's work, but the annotations also tell you a second story about how directors have broken traditional casting expectations over the years. <strong>&mdash;Sisi Wei</strong>"},{"type":"text","value":"While other topics may sound more relevant for humanity, this is a story that communicates how much the person who worked on it is passionate about the topic and how interesting he has made it for others. The narration flows in a way that guides you if you don‚Äôt know much about the topic, but still lets you explore and get to the fine detail if you care deeply about it. It brings up the little anecdotes and details that makes this dataset more interesting and even funny, in a way that is not intrusive or feels artificial. <strong>&mdash;Chiqui Esteban</strong>"}]},{"title":"Twelve years in South Africa's schools","url":"http://passmark.org.za/schools/","name":"Laura Grant, Alastair Otter","img":"passmark","remarks":[{"type":"text","value":"I'm always looking for a \"whoa\" moment in a data story, and that's what this story delivers. The incremental layering of data guides readers through both the metaphor (dots as students) and the context (what we're looking for.) Then there's a moment near the end of the piece ‚Äî which I won't ruin ‚Äî where the authors crystalize the systemic problem with one, concise visual. And with that single gut-wrenching blow, we understand both why this broken the South African education system is so devastating. This piece builds a story arc around the data and its subjects, rather than the data scientist and their process, which is important when we try to convey that these spreadsheets describe real-life. This is by no means the most technical or elaborate data story, but it highlights the importance of writing, designing, and editing for an audience. <strong>&mdash;Alvin Chang</strong>"}]},{"title":"Trucks and beer","url":"https://www.johnwmillr.com/trucks-and-beer/","name":"John Miller","img":"trucksbeer","remarks":[{"type":"text","value":"Growing up just outside of Nashville, I‚Äôm <strong>very</strong> familiar with country music tropes &mdash; I feel like I‚Äôve lived at least a few of them. I‚Äôve theorized on the ‚Äúcountry song formula‚Äù with countless friends: start with a back road, add in a mud-covered truck, sprinkle in a girl in blue jeans, and top with a brewski. This piece turned all of my anecdotal experiences into cold hard data, and I loved every minute of it."}]}],"passionOtherHed":"Some of our other favorites","passionOther":[{"url":"https://constantlyplotting.com/whats-that-sound-again/","title":"What's That Sound Again?"},{"url":"https://mandicai.github.io/maternity-leave/","title":"Maternity Leave in the US"},{"url":"http://masalov.design/the-most-conspiratorial-place-in-the-us/","title":"What is the Most Conspiratorial Place in the US?"},{"url":"http://www.verysmallarray.com/best-new-york-city-neighborhoods-again/","title":"Best New York City neighborhoods, again"},{"url":"https://jsteele2003.github.io/msdv_thesis/redlining/dist/index.html","title":"Moving the Line - Shifting Borders and Disparities in American Cities"},{"url":"https://medium.com/athenslivegr/mapping-the-dominance-of-airbnb-in-athens-4cb9e0657e80","title":"Mapping The Dominance Of Airbnb On Athens"},{"url":"http://tidbits.fyi/candles","title":"Yankee Candle - Making Scents of Emotions"},{"url":"http://thedataface.com/2018/06/politics/refugees","title":"A Look at the Global Refugee Crisis"},{"url":"https://datanibbl.es/tracing-kpop-wave/","title":"Tracing the K-Pop Wave"},{"url":"https://www.marcuscb.fyi/samples-by-the-numbers","title":"Samples by the Numbers"}],"hed2":"Pay Tier","dek2":"The best stories created as part of a job.","pay":[{"title":"How hard is it to make a believable deepfake?","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-28/fake-news-how-hard-is-it-to-make-a-deepfake-video/10313906","name":"Tim Leslie, Nathan Hoad, Ben Spraggon","org":"ABC News (Australia Broadcasting Corp)","img":"deepfake","remarks":[{"type":"text","value":"I thought it was not only fun and novel in its execution, but a great example of explanatory, visually-driven journalism, too.
